              <h3>Who Is Guru Vishnu?</h3>
              <p >Who Am I, I am not this physical body or mind. I am merely a servant of humanity, a servant of my students.</p>

              <p>My Guru parampara, guides me on this spiritual journey through the physical complexities of life and reality. The lineage and traditional teachings are alive within me, my gurus live in my heart and this is my gift to them, my gift to humanity, to spread their teachings of yoga and spirituality, to transform one being so that they can become their most authentic self.</p>

              <p>My life itself is a message, I am human, I make mistakes, these mistakes are the stepping stones for me to continue my journey as they teach me the greatest of lessons’ -<strong> Yogi Vishnu</strong></p>

              <p><strong>A spinner of joy, a farmer of wisdom, and support for those who need guidance - a ray of light that the world needs as he showers his grace with no bias, for you to learn and feel you only need to be receptive.</strong></p>

                <p>My experiences enriched and deepened my spiritual journey, These experiences taught me several things in life in the face of adversity.</p>

                <p>My spiritual journey has bought bhakti and devotion in my life, it has made me realize that God resides within me and this interconnectedness with the divine is what guides me through life. My life challenges opened my mind to see the beauty of within and the beauty externally. My most profound experience was when I realized that I had a congenital heart defect, and if I didn’t seek treatment I would die, I came from extremely humble beginnings and we had no money for the operation or treatment. My body would literally shake due to the defect.  Where would I end up, how do I not die? What is the purpose of my life – all these questions would spin in my mind, who would help me? there was no one here on this earth at that point in time to help me survive or live. This is where bhakti and my devotion to God came into my heart, I had to have blind faith in the universe, in the god that I would live, Miraculously, I stumbled upon a hospital that agreed to treat me. In India, at the time of my operation, there was no guarantee of success. As I went under anesthesia, not knowing if I would wake, it was here that I truly connected to my heart and the divine within and the power of prayer, meant that when I opened my eyes I was born again, an opportunity to serve humanity and guide on people on the spiritual path(Hosptial of operation- Sri Satya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Science)</p>

                <p>I promised at this point I would spread the word of bhakti and devotion. That I would spend my life for devotion and spreading spirituality challenges and adversity are a part of life, however how we overcome, can make all the difference, every challenge strengths our will, life is never about the position we have in life, but that we see our self as we really are and take our soul journey.</p>

            <hr>
         <p class="text-white">Even before he came to the physical world - Yogi Vishnu was steeped in spiritual endeavors- his mother being the vessel to bring to the world through deep prayer & devotion a spiritual devotee.</p>

         <p class="text-white">Growing up he followed the advice of his grandfather and meditated for salvation and moksha not the rituals or prayers for worldly materials. Vishnu would frequently serve the wandering Sadhu’s, many of which come from the special sect of knowledge bearing Hatha- yogis - ‘Kum- phatia baba’s’ and their presence in Vishnu’s life left a lasting impression.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase text-white">1st Spiritual Encounter</h3>
<hr>

        <p class="text-white">Vishnu gave his time to support the ill and needy at a nearby hospital.  An old man who was neglected and had severe issues crossed Vishnu’s path. This was his first test - Vishnu cared for the old man over the coming days, and as a result, Vishnu was blessed by this soul.  Many thought Vishnu had become a servant and mocked him for caring for this man, Vishnu from a Brahmin caste was not meant to mix with those from lower castes, However, his inner strength remained true and he did not relent against the caste system in his village.</p>

        <p class="text-white">After this blessing, the old man vanished and no one remembered or could say he had been there  it was almost as though God himself had come to test Vishnu’s devotion</p>
            

        <h3 class="text-uppercase text-white"> 2nd Spiritual Encounter</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="text-white">The Yogi gave Vishnu shelter and provided a cave for him to mediate in - whilst in mediation, Vishnu saw a cobra - as he closed his eyes and composed his mind - his inner being spoke</p>

        <li><img src="images/icn2.png"> &nbsp;  Age 18 A- meeting with Vedanta Keshari Swami Niranjanji ‘Lion of Vedanta’ Vishnu studied for 2 years whilst at the same time acquiring a BA degree in Arts at Jyoti Vihar University.</li>
        <li><img src="images/icn2.png"> &nbsp; Age 20 - Vishnu took his path of devotion cultivating universal love and sankirtan - Through the Bhakti tradition and his days and nights passed in prayers and mantra recitations following the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu tradition from the 15th Century.</li>
        <li><img src="images/icn2.png"> &nbsp; His greatest challenge- Vishnu was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect and needed open surgery. With no money or support, he set off for treatment - keeping God and his resolve in his heart.</li>
    </ul>
        

<hr>
        <p class="text-justify mt-5">After this Vishnu went through the physical world duties of organizing camps, spiritual programs, and Satsang in and around his village- serving mostly the poor and underprivileged. He cultivated land and agriculture eventually losing it all to flooding - however, this was the blessing that would bring Vishnu to Rishikesh. </p>

        <h3> Rishikesh</h3> 

       <p>On his arrival to the Himalayas, Vishnu crossed paths with a sadhu - who would prepare him for his time with Swami Rama.</p>

       <p>To take the path of the traditional Himalayan Yoga he was scolded, and told not to be fearful - and was told to throw all his belongings to Ganga - to part with all the worldly belongings is when you get the real God told the Sadhu</p>
